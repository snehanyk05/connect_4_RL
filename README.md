A Connect Four game is programmed to have it train itself through self-play and reinforcement
learning. The improvement in performance is recorded as a function of the number of games
played.

STEPS TO EXECUTE:

1. The language that was used for this assignment is python3.

2. Pygame was used for the GUI.

3. The GitHub link for the assignment is as below:
https://github.com/snehanyk05/connect_4_RL

4. To set up the environment, follow the following steps:
● git clone -b https://github.com/snehanyk05/ connect_4_RL .git
● cd into connect_4_RL
● Install pygame using pip3 - pip3 install pygame
● Run python3 main_connect_four.py <<iterations>> , where <<iterations>> is the number of episodes you want to run the training session for.
  
5. On the GUI, Choose the “ Train Computer ” option first for training the network.This will take
into consideration the iterations you first passed as arguments.

6. Once the training is complete, choose the “ vs Computer ” option to play with an RL agent.

7. The “ 2 player Mode ” is just for 2 human agents to play each other.

8. “QUIT” to exit.
